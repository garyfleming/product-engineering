# Possible TODOs.

* Consider embedding I don't care talk - it's about product thinking
  * 
* Ambiguity of value - What kind do you mean? Agree up front. Consider using OKRs

* https://jpattonassociates.com/evaluating-product-managers/

* engineering have to help product understand the cost of each option to build each feature - cost to build, maintain, cost to complexity that will affect other features (this is the painful one)

* roadmaps and goals as framing

* Everyone has opinions. Data wins. Benefits everyone. Use it to pick features, enhance features, support features, remove features.

* Melissa Perri interview w/ Kent Beck: https://produxlabs.com/product-thinking-blog/episode-38-kent-beck

* shared bias to action. Shipping beats almost everything (caveats around delighting users). If one partner has a different stance (build the whole thing), then it’ll be bad times

* think about product antipattenes (treating like a project) and engineering antipatterns (feature churn), and how they impact the other role

* dashboards for PO. Feature toggles for po

* Good aligning principle for internal systems - would users use your system if they didn’t have to?

* what’s the best thing we can do for our customer. Shift emphasis between best thing, we, can do. i.e. "what's the *best thing* we can do ...", "what's the best thing *we* can do..." "what's the best thing we *can do*..."

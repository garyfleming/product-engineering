# Possible TODOs.

* Consider embedding I don't care talk - it's about product thinking
  * 
* Ambiguity of value - What kind do you mean? Agree up front. Consider using OKRs

* https://jpattonassociates.com/evaluating-product-managers/

* engineering have to help product understand the cost of each option to build each feature - cost to build, maintain, cost to complexity that will affect other features (this is the painful one)

* Aligned posture on dates

* Power over, power with, and to - Mary Parker Follett

* Anti-pattern: only product speaks to customers
* anti-pattern: only engineering makes stack decisions
  * With understanding of cost and scaling trade-offs, this can be a product decision

* roadmaps and goals as framing

* Everyone has opinions. Data wins. Benefits everyone. Use it to pick features, enhance features, support features, remove features.

* Melissa Perri interview w/ Kent Beck: https://produxlabs.com/product-thinking-blog/episode-38-kent-beck
  * "when you have somebody with a capability, talk to somebody with a need, and that conversation creates a value. And, um, so in the extreme programming model, a product manager is more like a cocktail party host, making sure that the right introductions are made, making sure that the right conversations happen, that if somebody needs to join a conversation that happens as opposed to being, uh, uh, kind of, uh, a chess player and moving all the pieces around and figuring out where everything's gonna go perfectly."

* shared bias to action. Shipping beats almost everything (caveats around delighting users). If one partner has a different stance (build the whole thing), then it’ll be bad times

* think about product antipattenes (treating like a project) and engineering antipatterns (feature churn), and how they impact the other role

* dashboards for PO. Feature toggles for po

* Good aligning principle for internal systems - would users use your system if they didn’t have to?

* what’s the best thing we can do for our customer. Shift emphasis between best thing, we, can do. i.e. "what's the *best thing* we can do ...", "what's the best thing *we* can do..." "what's the best thing we *can do*..."

* Product pairings that worked and didnt
  * M & CM 
  * N & L
  * L & T
  * TH & TM - dates

* part of effectiveness in larger orgs is networking. Making sure that you’re linking up people who need to know each other including your product partners.

* what are the big questions you want to answer? Are they the same? Where do they differ?

* this thread about ensuring your strategy comes from what you want to solve. https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1759293490276761829

* engineers usually focus on a strategy to save the system they’re working on. Not the broader product, but specifically the system they have. Neither would be right. Must evolve the product and system to meet needs and derive value.
* similarly product owners will over focus on the product not the needs.

* thinking about now next later and even much later (years). Ensure you’re aligned on what those mean. That they’re not promises to do stuff, they’re possibilities. They’re not backlogs. Ensure you’re laying the engineering and product groundwork.

* how to deal with tech debt - product owners who don't know how it affects delivery are doomed to fail and develop a worsening relationship. Engineers who focus on it at the cost of delivery will fail too.
  * Strategies like "x% of time for tech debt" are usually naive - they lack context, and are usually the first thing cut.

* Quadrant diagram - Can we frame the majority of the talk around this? Kind of product (internal vs external) against kind of company (enterprise vs startup)
  * Use this to explore personas


* Common points of interest and contention
  * Tech debt
  * prioritisation
  * roadmap
  * dates (and fungibility)
  * metrics
  * decision making/ownership

* The product is not the code
  * 

* TL;DR
  * Build the relationship and build empathy
  * Understand where each partner wants to be
  * Find out how to get there
  * Understand the company context and how it changes - figure out where to act

* Metrics - what ones do you agree on?
  * KPIs for internal product: https://www.pendo.io/pendo-blog/5-kpis-for-internal-product-managers-to-track/
    * App adoption: Monthly active users (MAU)
    * Support deflection: measure tickets before tool, then after. Non user support requests, vs user support requests
    * Net Promoter Score (I'm down on this)

# Possible TODOs.

* Consider embedding I don't care talk - it's about product thinking
  * 
* Ambiguity of value - What kind do you mean? Agree up front. Consider using OKRs

* https://jpattonassociates.com/evaluating-product-managers/


* Product pairings that worked and didnt
  * M & CM - Engineering focussed product. Domain expert. Not used to working with product. Not interested in ceding ground.
  * N & L - Very different approaches to work. No attempt to work better together. Made worse by one working for the other. 
  * L & T - 
  * TH & TM - dates
  * JC & one of the leads


* Quadrant diagram - Can we frame the majority of the talk around this? Kind of product (internal vs external) against kind of company (enterprise vs startup)
  * Use this to explore personas



* The product is not the code
  * 

* TL;DR
  * Build the relationship and build empathy
  * Understand where each partner wants to be
  * Find out how to get there
  * Understand the company context and how it changes - figure out where to act

n.b. Many of these items fit in multiple categories. Consider tagging each thing with multiple categories


# Structure / disposition



* think about product antipattenes (treating like a project) and engineering antipatterns (feature churn), and how they impact the other role



# decision making/ownership


  



* dashboards for PO. Feature toggles for po

* shared bias to action. Shipping beats almost everything (caveats around delighting users). If one partner has a different stance (build the whole thing), then itâ€™ll be bad times


* Melissa Perri interview w/ Kent Beck: https://produxlabs.com/product-thinking-blog/episode-38-kent-beck
  * "when you have somebody with a capability, talk to somebody with a need, and that conversation creates a value. And, um, so in the extreme programming model, a product manager is more like a cocktail party host, making sure that the right introductions are made, making sure that the right conversations happen, that if somebody needs to join a conversation that happens as opposed to being, uh, uh, kind of, uh, a chess player and moving all the pieces around and figuring out where everything's gonna go perfectly."



* Power over, power with, and to - Mary Parker Follett

# Possible TODOs.


Self feedback after last time we did this: Back half isn't coherent with the front. Sections are underdeveloped. Stuff like tech debt doesn't feel like an organisational pattern. People really like the stuff on timespans of discretion 

----

* Consider embedding I don't care talk - it's about product thinking
  * 
* Ambiguity of value - What kind do you mean? Agree up front. Consider using OKRs

* https://jpattonassociates.com/evaluating-product-managers/


* Product pairings that worked and didnt
  * M & CM - Engineering focussed product. Domain expert. Not used to working with product. Not interested in ceding ground.
  * N & L - Very different approaches to work. No attempt to work better together. Made worse by one working for the other. 
  * L & T - 
  * TH & TM - dates
  * JC & one of the leads


* Quadrant diagram - Can we frame the majority of the talk around this? Kind of product (internal vs external) against kind of company (enterprise vs startup)
  * Use this to explore personas



* The product is not the code
  * 

* TL;DR
  * Build the relationship and build empathy
  * Understand where each partner wants to be
  * Find out how to get there
  * Understand the company context and how it changes - figure out where to act

n.b. Many of these items fit in multiple categories. Consider tagging each thing with multiple categories


# Structure / disposition



* think about product antipattenes (treating like a project) and engineering antipatterns (feature churn), and how they impact the other role



# decision making/ownership


  



* dashboards for PO. Feature toggles for po

* shared bias to action. Shipping beats almost everything (caveats around delighting users). If one partner has a different stance (build the whole thing), then it’ll be bad times


* Melissa Perri interview w/ Kent Beck: https://produxlabs.com/product-thinking-blog/episode-38-kent-beck
  * "when you have somebody with a capability, talk to somebody with a need, and that conversation creates a value. And, um, so in the extreme programming model, a product manager is more like a cocktail party host, making sure that the right introductions are made, making sure that the right conversations happen, that if somebody needs to join a conversation that happens as opposed to being, uh, uh, kind of, uh, a chess player and moving all the pieces around and figuring out where everything's gonna go perfectly."



* Power over, power with, and to - Mary Parker Follett
> Definitely need to add this early

"Can be as simple as agreeing how we build our roadmap and communicate that to the team, and how the team communicate back" -- Using this in constraints in teams section. Make sure these get answered

---

real conversations - what are they


---

Have real Conversations

^ Quite the opposite. I'm saying have conversations. Align the mission and values. Create lightweight touchpoints. and keep talking. If any

---

put real conversation slide earlier. Explain that you know if having these conversations was easy you’d be having them. You’ll be providing tools

NEED TO ENSURE WE ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING TOOLS

--

Product change: add visuals of org chart showing product and engineering side by side. Add bit on who should be in charge: can either be two separate trees or same boss (product, engineering or other) - but latter can being in bias

---

SHould "professional symphathy for each other's roles is important" be a slide.
Talk about how understanding a little about what you each do is the basis of good work?

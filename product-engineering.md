* Welcome
    * Jump to the end - before I explain what the talk is about, the answer to the problems I'm setting out and most other unrelated problems is "Have more real conversations"
        * Talk more, be honest more, listen more, have them be actual conversations
        * You're now relieved of the burden of listening to the talk
        * If you have to talk notes to take back to your company, that's you sorted. You're welcome.
    * My name is...
        * 
    * This talk is called...
        * Yes, I did call it that largely for the alliterative effect.
        * No, it's not big or clever
        * Yes, I've already renamed it for future conferences

* Disclaimer
    * From my company: Before we get too far in, have to say...
    * From me: The examples are all real - I've seen them throughout my career. I am, however, anonymising the names and companies involved, and simplifying/smoothing the stories for the sake of writing this.
    * Nothing is true, everything is permitted
        * ^ Could be seen as cynical - but really it means that we're in control of our actions and are responsible for our outcomes. If anything I say doesn't apply to you, don't apply it.


* What this is about
    * This talk is about product managers and engineering leads, and their failing relationships
    * This is about when those people try to work together and it goes wrong; or when they don't try to work together at all and it still goes horribly wrong. The horrible disastrous mistakes people make that can be overcome, and how you start doing that.
    * While the framing of the talk is on those two roles, I think it's also useful to adjacent roles - particularly agile coaches and scrum masters. If you can start to identify the problems I'll mention, you can start to work with the affected parties to fix things.
    * As we go through, I'm going to give you examples of failures, their causes, the results, and some ideas on how to appraoch things differently. 
    * But I remind you that you can mostly tune out if you rememember to "Have more real conversations"

^ The purpose of the examples is to explain the common anti-patterns and problems, the misalignments
^ We might intersperse the answers or not
^ Come up with fun names
^ Not convinced this is going to align to other stuff come back to it later

* Example: Nathan and Linda
    * Nathan 
        * engineering lead for large platform that supports other applications
        * Quiet, calm, understated
        * Focus on operational availability - making sure things keep running in a boring way. Boring is good.
        * Measures success based on number of tickets closed. The more tickets closed, the happier.
    * Linda
        * 


^ ------------------ Come back to the above later

* Multi-dimensional
    * Can be misaligned in multiple ways at the same time, which can be challenging
    * Positions
        * Where each person sits on a particular issue
    * Posture
        * Where the product fits in the world
            * Internal vs External
            * Small company vs Enterprise
    * Performance

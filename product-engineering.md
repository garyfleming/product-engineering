* Welcome
  * Jump to the end - before I explain what the talk is about, the answer to the problems I'm setting out and most other unrelated problems is "Have more real conversations"
    * Talk more, be honest more, listen more, have them be actual conversations
    * You're now relieved of the burden of listening to the talk
    * If you have to talk notes to take back to your company, that's you sorted. You're welcome.
  * My name is...
    * 
  * This talk is called...
    * Yes, I did call it that largely for the alliterative effect.
    * No, it's not big or clever
    * Yes, I've already renamed it for future conferences

* Disclaimer
  * From my company: Before we get too far in, have to say...
  * From me: The examples are all real - I've seen them throughout my career. I am, however, anonymising the names and companies involved, and simplifying/smoothing the stories for the sake of writing this.
  * Nothing is true, everything is permitted
    * ^ Could be seen as cynical - but really it means that we're in control of our actions and are responsible for our outcomes. If anything I say doesn't apply to you, don't apply it.

* What this is about
  * This talk is about product managers and engineering leads, and their failing relationships
  * This is about when those people try to work together and it goes wrong; or when they don't try to work together at all and it still goes horribly wrong. The horrible disastrous mistakes people make that can be overcome, and how you start doing that.
  * While the framing of the talk is on those two roles, I think it's also useful to adjacent roles - particularly agile coaches and scrum masters. If you can start to identify the problems I'll mention, you can start to work with the affected parties to fix things.
  * As we go through, I'm going to give you examples of failures, their causes, the results, and some ideas on how to appraoch things differently. 
  * But I remind you that you can mostly tune out if you rememember to "Have more real conversations"
  
* Roles
  * Going to use product owner/manager/CPO interchangeably
  * Going to use engineering lead/team lead/developer interchangeably.
  * I'll usually be referring to people who are at broadly the same level.

* Context
  * Definitely on the engineering side...
  * Was an agile coach for years
  * I am not now and never have been a product owner
    * But I have trained/coached POs in  a past life.
  * If you're product/engineering, look for these anti-patterns and how they both benefit and hinder you. Just because they can have an immediate benefit doesn't make them a good thing - can harm relationship
  * If you're agile, look at how you can illuminate these problems for those invovled

^ The purpose of the examples is to explain the common anti-patterns and problems, the misalignments
^ We might intersperse the answers or not
^ Come up with fun names
^ Not convinced this is going to align to other stuff come back to it later

* Example: Nathan and Linda
  * Nathan 
    * engineering lead for large platform that supports other applications
    * Quiet, calm, understated
    * Focus on operational availability - making sure things keep running in a boring way. Boring is good.
    * Measures success based on number of tickets closed. The more tickets closed, the happier.
    * Some of the big changes that are needed aren't getting done. By only focussing on the symptoms and fighting those, they rarely look for the root cause and fix there to reduce tickets.
  * Linda
    * Has worked in multiple roles and has now settled into Product management
    * Opinionated, loud, one of life's complainers
    * Can see the issues upstream and knows they need fixed - knows that tickets are a symptom
    * Can't get traction because started with everything that is wrong. Didn't build relationships and trust. Just complained (about stuff that really was broken)
    * Aligned *under* Nathan, so is being loudly dismissive of her manager's approach.
  
* Example: Matt and Ken Michaelson
  * Ken
    * Engineering lead for tools for develophers
    * Expert in his domain.
    * Has historically made excellent decisions
    * Been given a PM - not used to working with them
    * Has no interest in ceding ground
  * Matt
    * Experienced PO moved in from another area (Cloud?) because dev tooling need to start focussing more tools on Cloud
    * Well connected and knowledgeable
    * Abrasive at times, but no right
  * No direct power dynamic but their mutual boss clearly favoured engineering - and Matt had significant seniority
  * Ken said what he was going to do, and took no feedback. Matt's only role was then to produce reports and OKRs to accomodate and justify decisions made - not really doing any product management.

* Example: Jessica and Steve
  * Jessica
    * Product manager trying to make a name for herself
    * Put in charge of wayward external facing project - an integration platform for customers
    * Project is delivering slowly so puts in place a timeline of when new features will be delivered - tells stakeholders
  * Steve
    * New engineering lead - old one left
    * Reports directly to Jessica (as does everyone in engineering)
    * Talks about his concerns with the dates but can't say how long anything will take - Technical debt makes delivery unpredictable
  * Jessica tells Steve to deliver and demands reports when he will be late. Blames him for failure of dates that he didn't create but also can't give better dates.
  * Jessica doesn't understand tech debt but says the engineering team can have 10% of their sprint to deal with it. It's not remotely enough.


* Do any of those scenarios sound familiar? Do some or all of them resonate with an experience you've had? Let's talk about some of the details

^ ------------------ Come back to the above later

* Multi-dimensional
    * Can be misaligned in multiple ways at the same time, which can be challenging
    * Positions
        * Where each person sits on a particular issue
        * Where the person sits in the org chat relative to the other 
    * Posture
        * Where the product fits in the world
            * Internal vs External
            * Small company vs Enterprise
    * Performance
      * How each person is performing relative to the overall need and each other





# What Good (might) look like

Dispositional. No one answer. Things below are broadly applicable (or called out as being specific)

* Product strategy
    * Strategy comes from what you want to solve 
    * Not derived from a vision statement - a vision statement distills the strategy after the fact - an elevator pitch that hides the detail
    * Start with big questions that you want to answer that either illuminate or directly answer a users needs  https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1759293490276761829
